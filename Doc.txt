1. Training CNN over .data/train
2. Validation performed on .data/eval
3. Taking Handwritten mathematical input and separating each digit/signs whenever np.sum > threshold (white space > set threshold pixels).
   Storing all obtained digits in a folder
4. Iterating all images in folder and obtaining it's output using our model
5. Return output is same sequence as input
